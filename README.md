Detecting the misuse of AI as a service, a masters dissertation project

Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) offers pre-built AI models to customers looking to leverage AI capabilities with minimal cost and risk. This
thesis is predicated on the fact that various pre-built models are being offered as a service, on demand, often with little oversight. Given the generic
functionality of the AI models available, and the lack of oversight from service providers, there is a large scope for misuse. This thesis implements and
evaluates a variety of mechanisms for uncovering possible AIaaS misuse that can identify ‘signals’ and ‘signatures’ in customer usage data that could indicate potential bad behaviour.
